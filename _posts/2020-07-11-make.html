<p>So, the world is burning and I figured I'd make a blog.</p>

<p>Hello, and welcome to my online abode. I'm James, a recent Computer Science graduate from Stony Brook. I like programming, lifting weights, playing guitar and gardening. I also enjoy watching weird movies with my friends (well, virtually nowadays).</p>

<p>That's what I'd start off with if these were normal circumstances. Ultimately however, these are not. Let's face it - the world is in a weird place. No one knows what tomorrow will bring, so it's probably best just to enjoy what we can every day and do our part to make the world a better place. Part of enjoying every day is, of course, making sure your mental health is in check. This is the first reason I'm making this blog - a sort of social outlet in otherwise asocial times. The other reason is a bit more boring - I graduated college. Ultimately, unless mandated by a future job, my time spent writing has decreased to nil. I'm probably one of the few people in my major who thoroughly enjoys writing. It's a sort of creative endeavor. As such, I'd prefer not to permit my skills to atrophy. So, here we are. Ultimately the content that I will post here will be entirely random. Just topics that cross my mind and otherwise are of interest to me. A significant chunk of that, however, will be my personal projects for coding, and explaining some of the thought processes behind them. Hopefully I can finally get around to building Wall-E. I promise I will document that here.</p>
