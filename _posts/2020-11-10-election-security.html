    Well, this has been an eventful week. We had an election. We topped 100,000 cases of coronavirus. And now,
    the state of democracy in America has been thrown into question. I will not weigh in on the legitimacy of an election,
    nor will I endorse any person for the office. Whilst this is a post about politics, it is apolitical in the sense that
    it will not show any favor to any one person. Instead, it will explain some problems with
    integrating modern technology into elections. This is largely a look into the future at what many predict elections will
    look like

    One of the obvious things to expand voter turnout is to put the vote online. That is, have capability of voting in the comfort
    of your own home via some sort of web application. This would almost assuredly compromise the validity of an election.
    We know that in most web applications, there are some vulnerabilities - both simple in terms of SQL Injections, as well as
    zero-days (bugs that exist but haven't been used commonly/discovered) that we really don't know about. 
    If one were saving a zero-day for a good ocassion, I can't think of one that is 
    better for bad actors than a presidential election. We already know that other countries have made (and succeeded) in
    meddling with our elections. We've historically done the same. It's like a fog in a swamp. You know there are dangerous
    wild animals there, but you can't see them, so the best course of action is to take as many precautions as possible.
    Simply put, we cannot allow this to happen.

    This does not mean that software cannot be used in counting votes however - it of course, already is. The way in which it should work,
    however, is reading ballots and scanning them locally. That is, that all the computation is performed on the computer, and it has no actual
    communication with the outside world. No connection to the wifi, no open ports, nothing. It should scan ballots, and any uncertainties
    brought about by the machine should be looked over by a human. Poll watchers should be able to monitor and confirm ballot counts when
    cast, and in turn, the group overseeing the polling place - consisting of different groups - democrats, republicans, neutral parties,
    then report the numbers themselves. To further ensure transparency, the company should not be able to have any monetary transactions with
    any political action commitees, lobbying groups, etc. Once again, software can be used responsibly to ensure a secure election.

    Before I end this post, I'd like to add one thing. Perhaps this is political, and perhaps I lied in the beginning. This election has easily
    been the most divisive in my lifetime. Its significance in our culture cannot be understated. And yet it is almost split exactly down the middle.
    I suppose what I'm saying is - reach out to the other side. Regardless of your political opinions, if you're American, you're on the same team.
    You might have different views, but you want the best for society. Perhaps now is a time to stop shouting at one another and start listening.
    Instead of vilifying one another, we should try to have open dialogue. We have to.
